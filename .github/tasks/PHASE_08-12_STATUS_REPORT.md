**Date:** 2025-10-08
**Reporter:** AI Agent
**Workspace Status:** 427 tests passing

---

## Executive Summary

After creating comprehensive phase planning documents (Phase 08-12), an audit of the workspace reveals that several crates already have substantial implementation. This report documents the current state and recommends next steps.

---

## Current Implementation Status

### Phase 08 - Cardano Slotting (cardano-slotting)

**Status:** 🟡 **Partially Complete** - Core implementation exists, needs validation

#### What's Implemented ✅
- Core types: `SlotNo`, `EpochNo`, `EpochSize`, `WithOrigin`, `BlockNo`
- Time types: `SystemStart`, `SlotLength`, `RelativeTime`
- Epoch info providers: `FixedEpochInfo`, unsafe linear extension
- Basic arithmetic operations
- **17 tests passing** (11 unit + 6 integration)

#### What's Missing ❌
- Haskell cross-validation test vectors
- Property-based tests (overflow, monotonicity, associativity)
- CBOR serialization integration
- Extended epoch info for protocol transitions
- Performance benchmarks
- Comprehensive documentation
- Time conversion edge case tests

#### Estimated Remaining Effort
- **3-5 days** to add validation, tests, and documentation
- Much less than original 6-9 day estimate since core logic exists

---

### Phase 09 - Strict Containers (cardano-strict-containers)

**Status:** 🔴 **Not Started**

#### Current State
- Crate exists with basic module structure
- No implementation found in `src/`
- Needs: StrictSeq, StrictMap, StrictMaybe

#### Dependencies
- Requires `nothunks` crate (Phase 10) for validation
- Should wait for `nothunks` before major implementation

#### Recommendation
- **Start Phase 10 `nothunks` first**
- Then implement Phase 09 with proper validation

---

### Phase 10 - Helper Crates

#### deepseq
**Status:** 🟡 **Minimal Implementation**
- Basic crate structure exists
- Likely placeholder (Rust is strict by default)
- **Est: 0.5-1 day** to document rationale

#### heapwords
**Status:** 🟡 **Minimal Implementation**
- Basic crate structure exists
- Needs HeapSize trait and implementations
- **Est: 2-3 days** for full implementation

#### measures
**Status:** 🟡 **Minimal Implementation**
- Basic crate structure exists
- Needs metrics types (Stopwatch, Histogram)
- **Est: 2-3 days** for full implementation

#### nothunks
**Status:** 🔴 **Not Started** - **HIGH PRIORITY**
- Crate exists but no implementation
- **Blocks Phase 09** (strict containers need this)
- **Est: 2-3 days** for NoThunks trait + derives
- **Should start immediately**

---

### Phase 11 - Deriving-Via Crates

#### base-deriving-via
**Status:** 🟡 **Partially Complete**
- Some implementations exist (semigroup, InstantiatedAt)
- Needs Monoid trait, derive macros
- **Est: 3-4 days remaining**

#### orphans-deriving-via
**Status:** 🟡 **Minimal Implementation**
- Basic structure exists
- Needs newtype wrappers and trait impls
- **Est: 2-3 days**

---

### Phase 12 - Cardano Base (cardano-base)

**Status:** 🔴 **Not Started** (correctly blocks on 08-11)
- Empty crate, needs Phase 08-11 complete first
- **Est: 10-11 days** (unchanged from plan)

---

## Recommended Execution Order (Revised)

### Immediate Priority (This Sprint)

1. **Phase 10: nothunks** (2-3 days) - **START NOW**
   - Unblocks Phase 09
   - Self-contained, well-defined scope
   - Critical for memory safety validation

2. **Phase 08: cardano-slotting validation** (3-5 days) - **In Parallel**
   - Core logic exists, needs testing/validation
   - Independent of other phases
   - Lower risk, high value

### Next Sprint

3. **Phase 09: cardano-strict-containers** (10-12 days)
   - After `nothunks` ready
   - Integrate nothunks validation as implemented

4. **Phase 11: deriving-via completion** (5-7 days)
   - Can overlap with Phase 09
   - Provides ergonomic APIs for other crates

5. **Phase 10: remaining helpers** (4-5 days)
   - deepseq, heapwords, measures
   - Lower priority, can be incremental

### Final Sprint

6. **Phase 12: cardano-base integration** (10-11 days)
   - Only after Phase 08-11 complete
   - Final integration and release prep

---

## Revised Timeline Estimate

### Original Estimate (from REMAINING_PHASES_SUMMARY.md)
- **With parallelization:** 35-45 days

### Revised Estimate (accounting for existing work)
- **Phase 08:** 3-5 days (reduced from 6-9)
- **Phase 09:** 10-12 days (unchanged)
- **Phase 10:** 7-10 days total (nothunks 2-3, others 5-7)
- **Phase 11:** 5-7 days (reduced from 12-14)
- **Phase 12:** 10-11 days (unchanged)

**New Total:** **35-45 days** → **28-38 days** (1 week saved!)

## Test Count Progress

| Phase | Crate | Tests | Status |
|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| 03 | cardano-vrf-pure | 35 | ✅ Complete |
| 04 | cardano-crypto-class (DSIGN) | 31 | ✅ Complete |
| 05 | cardano-crypto-class (KES) | ~180 | ✅ Complete |
| 06 | cardano-crypto-class (Hash) | ~90 | ✅ Complete |
| 07 | cardano-binary | 86 | ✅ Complete |
| 08 | cardano-slotting | 17 | 🟡 Partial |
| 09 | cardano-strict-containers | 0 | 🔴 Not started |
| 10 | helpers | ~5 | 🔴 Minimal |
| 11 | deriving-via | ~3 | 🟡 Partial |

**Current Total:** 427 tests passing (workspace-wide)

---

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Start Phase 10: nothunks Implementation

Create `NoThunks` trait:
```rust
// nothunks/src/lib.rs
pub trait NoThunks {
    fn no_thunks(&self) -> Result<(), ThunkInfo>;
}
```

Implement for:
- Stdlib types (primitives, Vec, HashMap, Option, Result)
- Cardano types (crypto keys, containers, slotting)
- Derive macro for custom types

### 2. Continue Phase 08: Add Validation

- Extract Haskell test vectors for slot/time conversions
- Add property tests (QuickCheck/proptest)
- Integrate CBOR serialization tests
- Add benchmarks

### 3. Document Current State

- Update Phase 08 status to "In progress"
- Update Phase 10 (nothunks) status to "In progress"
- Add reporting cadence entries to phase documents

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Status | Mitigation |
|------|--------|--------|------------|
| nothunks delays Phase 09 | High | 🟡 Manageable | Start nothunks immediately, well-scoped task |
| Slotting validation uncovers bugs | Medium | 🟡 Possible | Core logic seems solid, but needs testing |
| Deriving-via macros complex | Medium | 🟢 Low | Can start with hand-written impls |
| Integration phase reveals API gaps | High | 🟢 Low | Phase 08-11 already partially implemented |

---

## Conclusion

The workspace is in better shape than the phase planning indicated. Core functionality for slotting and deriving-via already exists, reducing the total effort by approximately 1 week.

**Recommended Action:** Start Phase 10 (nothunks) implementation immediately while continuing Phase 08 validation in parallel. This unblocks the critical path to Phase 09 (strict containers) while making progress on the already-implemented slotting functionality.
