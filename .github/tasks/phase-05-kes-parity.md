# Phase 05 – KES Algorithm Parity

**Status:** ✅ Completed *(functional parity achieved; optional security & benchmarking items deferred)*  \
**Primary owners:** @FractionEstate  \
**Supporting crates:** `cardano-crypto-class`

---

## Objective

Validate and achieve 100% functional parity between the Rust KES (Key Evolving Signature) implementations and the reference Haskell implementations. KES is critical for Cardano's blockchain consensus protocol (Ouroboros Praos), providing forward-secure signatures that evolve over time periods.

## Success Criteria

- All KES implementations (SingleKES, SumKES, CompactSingleKES, CompactSumKES) pass comprehensive tests
- Test vectors extracted from Haskell reference and validated
- Key evolution, signing, and verification operations match Haskell byte-for-byte
- mlocked memory utilities function correctly (secure key storage, zeroisation)
- Period boundaries and expiration handling work correctly
- Forward security properties validated
- Documentation complete with usage examples

## Scope

### KES Algorithms to Cover

1. **SingleKES** - Basic KES with single period (wraps DSIGN)
2. **CompactSingleKES** - Single KES with embedded verification key
3. **SumKES** - Binary tree composition (Sum0 through Sum7)
4. **CompactSumKES** - Optimized sum with reduced verification keys (CompactSum0 through CompactSum7)

### Key Features

- **Forward Security**: Old keys cannot be reconstructed after evolution
- **Time Periods**: Keys evolve through discrete time periods
- **Merkle Tree Structure**: SumKES uses binary tree for key composition
- **Mlocked Memory**: Signing keys stored in secure memory (protected from swapping)
- **Key Evolution**: `update_kes` advances to next time period
- **Signature Verification**: Includes period validation

### Out of Scope (Not Implemented Yet)

- MockKES - Test-only implementation
- NeverUsedKES - Placeholder implementation
- SimpleKES - Alternative single period implementation

### Reporting cadence

**2025-10-08**: Added unified parity harness `kes_haskell_parity.rs` parsing hierarchical JSON fixtures (vectors / levels) and evolving keys per period. All parity tests pass (Single, CompactSingle, Sum1–7, CompactSum1–7). Updated `CHANGELOG.md` and `README.md` to reflect harness. Next focus: (a) optional VK hash field support if fixtures extended, (b) mlocked memory instrumentation & documentation tasks, (c) Haskell performance comparison & memory profiling, (d) forward-security narrative & migration guide.
**2025-10-08** (later): Introduced feature-gated `mlocked-metrics` (allocations, allocation_bytes, zeroizations, failed_locks). Instrumented `MLockedRegion` allocate/drop paths; added unit tests covering allocation, alignment rounding, zero-sized edge case, zeroization counting, and invalid alignment error. Next: document feature, integrate into CHANGELOG, and evaluate approach for inducing/observing `mlock` failure scenarios (may require resource limit manipulation; deferred).
**2025-10-08** (docs): Added forward security & period evolution narrative to `kes/mod.rs` and README, plus Haskell→Rust module mapping table. Updated documentation checklist (Section 11) to reflect completion. CHANGELOG already contains parity & metrics entries; no functional changes introduced.
**2025-10-08** (wrap-up): Functional parity achieved: all KES variants (Single, CompactSingle, Sum0–7, CompactSum0–7) validated against hierarchical fixtures; forward security tests and size regression guards in place; mlocked memory instrumentation (metrics) complete. Deferred: induced `mlock` failure tests, OS swap avoidance validation, Haskell comparative performance harness, memory usage reporting harness, formal security review, hashing suite parity (Phase 06).
- `cardano-crypto-class/src/kes/compact_sum.rs` - CompactSumKES family
- `cardano-crypto-class/src/kes/hash.rs` - Blake2b hashing for KES

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks

1. **Mlocked Memory Portability**: mlock behavior varies across platforms
   - Mitigation: Test on Linux, macOS, Windows; graceful degradation

2. **Forward Security**: Must ensure old keys cannot be recovered
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive zeroisation tests, security audit

3. **Period Evolution Correctness**: Off-by-one errors could break consensus
   - Mitigation: Extensive test coverage, cross-validation with Haskell

### Medium Priority Risks

1. **Verification Key Reconstruction**: CompactSum VK derivation is complex
   - Mitigation: Detailed test vectors, step-by-step validation

2. **Performance**: KES operations are on consensus critical path
   - Mitigation: Benchmark and optimize hot paths

3. **Memory Leaks**: Mlocked memory must be freed correctly
   - Mitigation: Use valgrind, check for leaks in CI

## Estimated Effort

- **Audit & Planning**: 1 day
- **Test Vector Extraction**: 1-2 days
- **SingleKES/CompactSingleKES Parity**: 1-2 days
- **SumKES Parity**: 2-3 days
- **CompactSumKES Parity**: 2-3 days
- **Mlocked Memory Security**: 1-2 days
- **Forward Security Validation**: 1 day
- **Integration Tests**: 1-2 days
- **Performance Benchmarks**: 1 day
- **Documentation**: 1-2 days
- **Total**: 12-20 days (approximately 2-4 weeks)

## Reporting Cadence

  - **2025-10-06**: Phase 05 initiated after DSIGN parity completion. Status: In progress, Owner: @FractionEstate.
  - **2025-10-07**: Consolidated KES coverage: generated deterministic Single/CompactSingle/Sum/CompactSum vectors (including evolution traces), added structural (`sum_kes_signature_components*`, `compact_sum3_kes_signature_components`), integration (`kes_integration`), cross-family (`kes_cross_family`), forward-security (`kes_forward_security`), tamper, and serialization edge-case regressions. Ran `cargo test -p cardano-crypto-class --features serde` and `cargo test -p cardano-test-vectors` to validate all suites. Future work: mlocked memory security validation, performance benchmarks, documentation polish.

---
  - 2025-10-08: Converted SumKES/CompactSumKES direct-serialise callbacks to safe slice-based closures (parity with `Cardano.Crypto.DirectSerialise`), purged remaining pointer plumbing, and re-ran the full KES regression matrix to confirm no behaviour drift.
