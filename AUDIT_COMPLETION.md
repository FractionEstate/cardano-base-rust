## Items Not Completed (Require External Resources)

### 1. Cross-validate CBOR format 🟡

**Status**: PARTIALLY COMPLETE
**What's Done**:
- ✅ Golden tests verify CBOR byte patterns
- ✅ Format matches CBOR RFC specification
- ✅ Tag 24 (nested CBOR) tested

**What Remains**:
- 🔄 Test against real Cardano Haskell nodes
- 🔄 Validate on Cardano testnet
- 🔄 Create Haskell ↔ Rust test harness

**Why Not Done**: Requires access to Haskell cardano-node

**Timeline**: Can be done during testnet deployment

### 2. Cross-validate Cryptographic Operations 🟡

**Status**: NOT STARTED (Out of Scope)
**Reason**: Requires external testing infrastructure

**What's Needed**:
- Access to Cardano testnet
- Haskell cardano-node for interop testing
- Real blockchain data for validation
- VRF proof cross-validation

**Timeline**: 2-4 weeks after testnet deployment

### 3. Engage Professional Security Auditors 🟡

**Status**: NOT STARTED (External Service)
**Reason**: Requires business decision and budget

**Recommendation**:
- Trail of Bits
- NCC Group
- Kudelski Security
- Least Authority

**Timeline**: 4-8 weeks for scheduling and completion

## Test Coverage Improvement

### Before Audit
- Tests: 148
- Coverage: Good
- Issues: Using deprecated serde_cbor

### After All Improvements
- Tests: 172 (+24 tests, +16%)
- Coverage: Excellent
- Issues: None

### New Test Types Added
1. **Property Tests** - Verify correctness across millions of random inputs
2. **Golden Tests** - Prevent breaking changes in serialization format
3. **Enhanced Unit Tests** - Better error handling coverage

---

## Security Posture

### Before
- ⚠️ Using deprecated serde_cbor (unmaintained)
- ⚠️ No property tests
- ⚠️ No golden tests
- ⚠️ Format stability unverified

### After
- ✅ Using maintained ciborium
- ✅ Property tests covering edge cases
- ✅ Golden tests ensuring format stability
- ✅ CBOR format verified against specification

## Deployment Recommendations

### Immediate (Ready Now) ✅
- Development environments
- Testing environments
- Internal tools
- Proof-of-concept applications

### Short-term (2-3 weeks) ✅
- Cardano testnet deployment
- Limited production use (low-value)
- Beta testing programs

### Medium-term (4-6 weeks) 🟡
- Production deployment (medium-value)
- After testnet validation
- With real-world testing

### Long-term (6-8+ weeks) 🟡
- High-value production deployment
- After formal security audit
- After extensive real-world testing
