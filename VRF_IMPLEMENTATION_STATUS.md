- ‚úÖ All 31 tests passing
- Time: 1 hour

### Current Status üîÑ

**Test Results:**
- ‚úÖ All 31 core cryptographic primitive tests passing (100%)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Integration test detects `InvalidPoint` error
- Issue: Point construction from field elements needs refinement

**What's Working:**
1. All field element operations
2. Elligator2 mapping logic
3. Montgomery to Edwards conversion (at field level)
4. Cofactor clearing
5. Prove/verify function structures

**What Needs Refinement:**
1. EdwardsPoint construction from custom FieldElement representation
   - The field operations work correctly
   - But converting to curve25519-dalek's EdwardsPoint fails
   - Need to ensure proper byte encoding/decoding

### Remaining Work (~5%)

**Step 7: Fix Point Construction (est. 2-3 hours)**
- Debug EdwardsPoint construction from field elements
- Options:
  1. Use curve25519-dalek's internal field types
  2. Fix byte encoding to match expected format
  3. Verify point is actually on curve before decompression

**Step 8: Validate All Test Vectors (est. 2-3 hours)**
- Load all 14 official test vectors from IntersectMBO/cardano-base
- Debug any remaining mismatches
- Iterate until 100% byte-exact compatibility

**Total Estimated Remaining:** 4-6 hours

### Technical Insight

The core cryptographic primitives (field operations, Elligator2, cofactor clearing) are all implemented and tested. The remaining issue is the "glue code" that connects our custom field element representation to curve25519-dalek's point types. This is a software engineering challenge rather than a cryptographic one.

4. **Testing & Debugging** (est. 4-6 hours)
   - ‚ùå Test against first test vector
   - ‚ùå Debug field operations
   - ‚ùå Debug point operations
   - ‚ùå Test all 14 vectors
   - ‚ùå Fix any remaining issues

### Not Started ‚ùå

**Step 3: Integration with draft03.rs**
- Wire up cardano_compat module
- Replace current VrfDraft03 implementation
- Est. time: 1 hour

**Step 4: Draft-13 Batch Compatibility**
- Apply same fixes to Draft-13
- Est. time: 2-3 hours

## Total Estimated Time

| Component | Lines | Time Estimate |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| Field Operations | ~400 | 3-4 hours |
| Montgomery Operations | ~300 | 2-3 hours |
| Point Operations | ~200 | 2 hours |
| Testing & Debugging | - | 4-6 hours |
| Integration | ~100 | 1 hour |
| Draft-13 | ~200 | 2-3 hours |
| **TOTAL** | **~1200** | **14-19 hours** |

## Current Blockers

1. **Elligator2 Complexity**: The core hash-to-curve requires ~1000 lines of low-level field and curve arithmetic
2. **Bit-Exact Matching**: Every operation must match C exactly, no room for optimization differences
3. **Limited Testing Visibility**: Can't validate incrementally - need full implementation before any test passes

## Risk Assessment

**Technical Risk: HIGH**
- Complex cryptographic code
- Easy to introduce subtle bugs
- Difficult to debug without working incrementally

**Time Risk: MEDIUM**
- Could take 15-20 hours of focused work
- Debugging could extend significantly if issues found

**Success Risk: MEDIUM**
- IF implementation matches C exactly: 100% success guaranteed
- IF any subtle difference exists: Tests fail, need debugging

## Alternative Approach Still Viable

At ANY point during this implementation, we can pivot to FFI bindings approach:
- Copy C files from cardano-crypto-praos
- Create Rust FFI wrappers
- Guaranteed 100% compatibility
- Time: 3-5 days total

The pure Rust approach is being attempted as requested, but the FFI option remains available if this proves too time-consuming or error-prone.

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Implement `fe25519_invert()` - Most complex field operation
2. Implement `fe25519_pow22523()` - Needed for square root
3. Implement `fe_notsquare()` - Quadratic residue check
4. Test field operations independently
5. Then move to Montgomery curve operations

## Status Updates

- **2025-01-XX**: Started implementation (commit 9110100)
- **Next update**: After completing field element operations
