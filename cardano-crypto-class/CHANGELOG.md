# Changelog for `cardano-crypto-class`

## Unreleased

* Start Rust port with `Seed` abstraction, deterministic `SeedRng`, packed
  byte utilities (`PackedBytes`), helper functions mirroring
  `Cardano.Crypto.Util`, pinned memory helpers (`PinnedSizedBytes`), mlocked
  seed storage (`MLockedSeed`), and zero-copy direct serialisation helpers
  mirroring `Cardano.Crypto.DirectSerialise`.
* Add DSIGN infrastructure (`dsign` module) together with a full Ed25519
  implementation, covering deterministic key generation, signing and
  verification, raw/direct serialisation, and mlocked key support.
* Introduce libsodium-style memory utilities, including runtime-length
  mlocked buffers, allocators, and low-level `zero_mem`/`copy_mem` helpers
  mirroring `Cardano.Crypto.Libsodium.Memory`.
* Added serde-gated CompactSumKES level-1 regression test consuming shared
  fixtures, keeping the compact tree implementation in sync with generated
  vectors.
* Extended CompactSumKES verification to reconstruct recursive verification
  keys, enabling parity for levels 1â€“7 alongside the SumKES hierarchy and the
  regenerated shared fixtures.
* Aligned `SingleKES`/`CompactSingleKES` key evolution with the Haskell
  reference and added boundary/tamper regression tests to lock down compact
  tree verification behaviour.
* Allow `PackedBytes` serde deserialisation to accept human-readable byte
  sequences as well as base64 strings, matching Haskell JSON fixtures.
