# Phase 3 Infrastructure Complete - Summary

**Date:** October 4, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ Infrastructure Ready, ‚è∏Ô∏è Awaiting Haskell Reference Values

## What Was Accomplished

### Documentation Created

1. **`PHASE3_HASKELL_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`** (~450 lines)
   - Complete guide for Haskell integration
   - Three different approaches documented (Haskell team, self-generate, extract from tests)
   - Detailed implementation plan with code examples
   - Test comparison framework design
   - CI integration strategy
   - Troubleshooting and debugging guides

2. **`generate_haskell_reference.sh`** (~150 lines)
   - Interactive script for Haskell reference value generation
   - Menu-driven interface
   - Haskell code template generator
   - JSON processing helpers
   - Detailed next steps

### Infrastructure Ready

‚úÖ **Rust Side Complete:**

- 30 test vectors with deterministic CBOR encodings
- 6 JSON files with structured test data
- 12 passing tests (11 active + 1 placeholder for Haskell)
- Test framework ready for comparison

‚úÖ **Integration Framework Designed:**

- JSON structure ready for Haskell values
- Comparison test functions designed
- Diff reporting strategy documented
- CI integration plan complete

‚úÖ **Multiple Paths Forward:**

- Option 1: Contact Haskell cardano-base maintainers
- Option 2: Self-generate using Haskell tooling
- Option 3: Extract from existing Haskell tests

## Current Blocker

üöß **External Dependency:** Obtaining Haskell CBOR reference values

This is not a technical blocker on our side - the infrastructure is complete and ready. We need:

1. **Haskell Reference Values:** For the same test vectors (seeds, messages, periods)
2. **Verification:** That Haskell values are generated correctly
3. **Integration:** Adding Haskell values to our test framework

## What's Next

### Immediate Next Steps (Choose One Path)

**Path A: Coordinate with Haskell Team** (Recommended)

```bash
# File issue on cardano-base repository
https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-base/issues/new

Subject: Rust Port - Request for CBOR Reference Values

Body:
We've completed a pure Rust port of cardano-crypto-class with full CBOR
serialization. We have 30 test vectors ready and need corresponding Haskell
CBOR values to verify byte-for-byte compatibility.

Test vectors available at: [link to our repo]
Algorithms: Ed25519, PraosVRF, SimpleVRF, MockVRF, SingleKes, CompactSingleKes

Can you help generate or point us to existing Haskell CBOR values?
```

**Path B: Setup Haskell Environment**

```bash
# In a separate terminal/environment
cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-base.git
cd cardano-base
stack build cardano-crypto-class

# Use our generate_haskell_reference.sh for guidance
# Adapt Haskell template to generate values
```

**Path C: Extract from Haskell Tests**

```bash
# Examine existing Haskell test suites
git clone https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-base.git
cd cardano-base/cardano-crypto-class/test
# Look for CBOR serialization tests and extract values
```

### After Obtaining Haskell Values

1. **Add to JSON Files:** Extend test vectors with `haskell_cbor` fields
2. **Implement Comparison:** Add test functions that compare Rust vs Haskell byte-for-byte
3. **Debug Mismatches:** If any occur, use detailed diff analysis
4. **Enable CI:** Add to continuous integration pipeline
5. **Document:** Update compatibility status in README

## Files Created

```

## Test Vector Inventory (Ready for Haskell)

| Algorithm | Vectors | JSON File | Rust CBOR | Haskell CBOR |

| Ed25519 | 5 | ed25519_vectors.json | ‚úÖ Ready | ‚è∏Ô∏è Needed |
| PraosVRF | 5 | praos_vrf_vectors.json | ‚úÖ Ready | ‚è∏Ô∏è Needed |

## Technical Readiness

### Rust Implementation: 100% Ready

- ‚úÖ All CBOR serialization implemented
- ‚úÖ All test vectors generated
- ‚úÖ All tests passing
- ‚úÖ Deterministic encoding verified
- ‚úÖ Canonical CBOR confirmed

### Comparison Framework: 100% Designed

- ‚úÖ Test structure defined
- ‚úÖ Comparison logic designed
- ‚úÖ Diff reporting strategy complete
- ‚úÖ CI integration planned
- ‚úÖ Debugging workflow documented

### Haskell Integration: 0% (External Dependency)

- ‚è∏Ô∏è Haskell values not yet obtained
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Comparison tests not yet implemented
- ‚è∏Ô∏è CI integration pending

## Metrics

### Documentation

- Phase 3 Guide: ~450 lines
- Helper Script: ~150 lines
- Total: ~600 lines of infrastructure documentation

### Test Coverage

- Algorithms: 6/6 (100%)
- Test Vectors: 30/30 (100%)
- CBOR Implementations: 18/18 types (100%)

### Completion Percentage

- Phase 1 (CBOR Implementation): 100% ‚úÖ
- Phase 2 (Rust Test Vectors): 100% ‚úÖ
- Phase 3 (Infrastructure): 100% ‚úÖ
- Phase 3 (Haskell Values): 0% ‚è∏Ô∏è
- Phase 3 (Comparison Tests): 0% ‚è∏Ô∏è (awaiting values)

## Recommendations

1. **Start with Path A (Haskell Team):**
   - Fastest if they have existing values
   - Builds community collaboration
   - Ensures values are authoritative

2. **Fallback to Path B if needed:**
   - Setup takes time but is self-contained
   - Full control over process
   - Can validate independently

3. **Use Path C as reference:**
   - Helpful for understanding Haskell implementation
   - May have different test cases
   - Good for additional validation

## Conclusion

**Phase 3 infrastructure is complete and production-ready.** The only remaining item is external coordination to obtain Haskell reference values. Once obtained, the comparison framework can be implemented in a matter of hours.

All design decisions have been made, all infrastructure is in place, and the path forward is clearly documented. This represents a clean, well-defined handoff point.

**Status:** Ready for external coordination or Haskell environment setup

**Blocked On:** Haskell cardano-base CBOR reference values

**Unblocks:** Complete cross-compatibility validation (Phase 3 final milestone)
