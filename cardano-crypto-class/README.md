# cardano-crypto-class (Rust)

A pure-Rust port of the original `cardano-crypto-class` package. The crate now
covers deterministic seed handling, Ed25519 DSIGN (including the mlocked
variant), secure memory helpers, VRF plumbing, and the family of
Cardano-specific Key Evolving Signatures (KES).

## Highlights

- **Deterministic entropy**: `Seed`, `SeedRng`, and `run_with_seed` mirror the
  Haskell APIs for reproducible randomness, with helpers to split, expand, and
  consume seed material (including mlocked variants).
- **Secure memory and packing**: `PackedBytes`, `PinnedSizedBytes`,
  `MLockedSeed`, and libsodium-style allocators provide safe, zeroed buffers
  for sensitive material, together with zero-copy direct-serialise traits.
- **DSIGN**: Ed25519 (pure + mlocked) parity harnesses exercise RFCÂ 8032 and
  Cardano fixtures housed in [`cardano-test-vectors`](../cardano-test-vectors).
- **KES**: `SingleKes`, `Sum{0-7}Kes`, and `CompactSum{0-7}Kes` share
  recursive verification-key reconstruction routines. Serde-gated fixtures keep
  CompactSum levelsÂ 1â€“7 in lock-step with the Haskell reference, and dedicated
  boundary tests assert expiry and tamper behaviour.
- **VRF plumbing**: The crate wires through Praos VRF primitives so higher
  layers can embed them without crossing FFI boundaries.
- **Hash utilities**: `hash::{sha256, sha3_256, keccak256, hash160, blake2b256, â€¦}`
  expose the same primitives as `Cardano.Crypto.Hash`, now backed by an
  expanded JSON vector suite in `cardano-test-vectors` to lock byte-for-byte
  parity across boundary and multi-block inputs.

## Hash parity coverage

The `hash` module mirrors the helpers from `Cardano.Crypto.Hash` and is now
(`"hello world"`), SHA-2 block boundaries (63/64/65 bytes), SHA3-256 rate
backed by JSON fixtures that cover empty inputs, classic sanity checks

boundaries (136/137 bytes), single-byte edge cases, a 1024-byte
multi-block pattern, and real-world composites such as the Bitcoin genesis
block header/public key and a canonical go-ethereum legacy transaction. Run
the parity harness with:
```bash
cargo test -p cardano-crypto-class --test hash_vectors
```

`hash_vectors.rs` loads `cardano-test-vectors/test_vectors/hash_test_vectors.json`
and asserts SHA-256, double SHA-256, SHA-512, SHA3-256, SHA3-512, Keccak-256,
RIPEMD-160, Hash160, Blake2b-256, and Blake2b-512 digests for every case. The
fixture itself is regenerated via the companion helper in
`cardano-test-vectors`:

```bash
cargo run -p cardano-test-vectors --bin generate_hash_vectors
```

Future PhaseÂ 06 work will fold in cross-language confirmations from the
Haskell generator and streaming edge cases once the scaffolding lands.

## DSIGN parity progress

| Algorithm | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Ed25519** | âœ… RFCÂ 8032 parity | Harness in `tests/dsign_ed25519_vectors.rs` exercises 11 scenarios, including official RFC vectors and Cardano-specific cases. Signatures and public keys match byte-for-byte. |
| **Ed25519 mlocked** | âœ… Functional parity | Mirrors Ed25519 behaviour with sensitive material kept in `MLockedSeed`. Shares the same serialization and verification logic. |
| **ECDSA secp256k1** | ðŸŸ¡ Harness passing* | RFCÂ 6979 deterministic nonces + low-s normalisation via `k256`. Vector harness (`tests/dsign_ecdsa_secp256k1_vectors.rs`) loads JSON fixtures and all tests pass locally. Formal cross-language parity review still pending. |
| **Schnorr secp256k1** | ðŸŸ¡ Harness passing* | BIP340-style Schnorr implementation backed by `k256`. Vector harness (`tests/dsign_schnorr_secp256k1_vectors.rs`) exercises sign/verify and error cases; all tests pass locally. Formal cross-language parity review still pending. |

*Harness passing indicates the Rust implementation deterministically reproduces and validates the embedded fixtures; a separate cross-language audit against the Haskell reference (and/or upstream spec vectors) will promote the status to full parity (âœ…).

## KES status snapshot

| Algorithm | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **SingleKes** | âœ… Vector + boundary | `tests/kes_single_vectors.rs` consumes JSON fixtures (serde-gated) while `tests/kes_boundary.rs` enforces expiry and out-of-range errors. Cross-language vectors are still to be captured. |
| **CompactSingleKes** | âœ… Vector + boundary | `tests/kes_compact_single_vectors.rs` validates embedded verification keys alongside boundary checks. |
| **Sum{0-7}Kes** | âœ… Vector harness | `tests/kes_sum_vectors.rs` walks Rust-generated fixtures to verify signing, verification, and evolution across all tracked periods. |
| **CompactSum{1-7}Kes** | âœ… Vector parity | Serde-gated fixtures in `tests/compact_sum_kes_vectors.rs` assert byte-for-byte signatures for levelsÂ 1â€“7, including evolution and tamper checks. |
| **Forward security** | âœ… Regression in place | `tests/kes_forward_security.rs` now walks every period for `Sum4Kes` and `CompactSum4Kes`, re-verifies historic signatures, rejects stale-period signing after each evolution, and asserts that rewind attempts fail with the expected errors. |
| **Cross-language parity harness** | âœ… Unified | `tests/kes_haskell_parity.rs` loads the hierarchical JSON fixtures (Single / CompactSingle vectors and Sum / CompactSum levels 1â€“7) and asserts byte-for-byte verification key & signature parity while evolving keys across periods, mirroring the Haskell generator structure. |

The harness now also cross-checks the stored raw signature envelopes and ensures every fixture ships with a description, keeping the JSON metadata exercised instead of silently drifting.

### Forward security & period evolution

Forward security means that once a signing key advances to a later period it is
cryptographically infeasible to recover the ability to sign for any previous
period. This crate enforces the property by:

1. Deriving fresh descendant keys (or leaf DSIGN keys) from limited-use secret
  material.
2. Zeroizing intermediate secrets immediately after they become unnecessary for
  future signatures.
3. Routing verification strictly by period and reconstructing internal node
  hashes / verification keys rather than storing all of them persistently.

Evolution behaviour per family:

| Family | Periods | Evolution behaviour | Notes |
|--------|---------|---------------------|-------|
| Single / CompactSingle | 1 | Fixed at period 0 | Any other period rejected. |
| Sum n | 2^n | Binary tree: first half uses left child; after midpoint switch to right; discard internal secrets as soon as children derived | Mirrors Haskell `Cardano.Crypto.KES.Sum` |
| CompactSum n | 2^n | Same schedule; signatures carry off-path VK enabling reconstruction | Saves space vs Sum by embedding fewer VKs |

Historic signatures remain valid after each `update_kes` step; attempts to sign
for an earlier period or beyond `total_periods()` return `KesError::PeriodOutOfRange`
or `KesError::KeyExpired` respectively.

### Haskell â†’ Rust mapping

| Haskell Module / Symbol | Rust Equivalent |
|-------------------------|-----------------|
| `Cardano.Crypto.KES.Class` | `kes::KesAlgorithm`, helpers in `kes::mod` |
| `hashVerKeyKES` | `KesAlgorithm::hash_verification_key_kes` |
| `Cardano.Crypto.KES.Single` | `kes::single::SingleKes` |
| `Cardano.Crypto.KES.CompactSingle` | `kes::compact_single::CompactSingleKes` |
| `Cardano.Crypto.KES.Sum` | `kes::sum::{Sum0Kes..Sum7Kes}` |
| `Cardano.Crypto.KES.CompactSum` | `kes::compact_sum::{CompactSum0Kes..CompactSum7Kes}` |
| `forgetSignKeyKES` | `KesAlgorithm::forget_signing_key_kes` |
| `updateKES` | `KesAlgorithm::update_kes` |
| `signKES` / `verifyKES` | `KesAlgorithm::sign_kes` / `verify_kes` |

Key takeaways from the latest DSIGN audit:

- Dedicated JSON fixtures for Ed25519, ECDSA, and Schnorr now live in
  `cardano-test-vectors/test_vectors/`, and the generator script at
  `.github/scripts/generate_dsign_test_vectors.sh` can rebuild them from the
  Haskell reference.
- Pending work focuses on byte-for-byte CBOR parity validation, richer error
  case testing (invalid signatures/keys), and extending the harnesses to cover
  RFCÂ 6979/BIPÂ 340 vectors once the scaffolding is in place.

## Tests

Run the complete suite (unit tests, property tests, KES boundary checks, and DSIGN harnesses) with:

```bash
cargo test -p cardano-crypto-class
```

The Ed25519 harness (`tests/dsign_ed25519_vectors.rs`) exercises:

- Four Cardano reference vectors migrated into `cardano-test-vectors`
- Three RFCÂ 8032 canonical vectors (empty, single-byte, multi-byte messages)
- Failure scenarios for mismatched messages and verification keys
- Serialization round-trips and large-message signing

Additional DSIGN harnesses for ECDSA and Schnorr will live alongside the
Ed25519 suite as PhaseÂ 04 progresses.

Serde-gated vector harnesses consume the shared JSON fixtures:

```bash
cargo test -p cardano-crypto-class --features serde --test kes_single_vectors
cargo test -p cardano-crypto-class --features serde --test kes_compact_single_vectors
cargo test -p cardano-crypto-class --features serde --test kes_sum_vectors
cargo test -p cardano-crypto-class --features serde --test compact_sum_kes_vectors
# Unified parity harness (covers Single, CompactSingle, Sum1â€“7, CompactSum1â€“7):
cargo test -p cardano-crypto-class --test kes_haskell_parity
```

`tests/kes_boundary.rs` focuses on evolution edge cases: Single/CompactSingle
expiry, CompactSum period rollovers, tamper detection for verification key
reconstruction, and out-of-range signing behaviour. To run only the boundary
suite:

```bash
cargo test -p cardano-crypto-class --test kes_boundary
```

Forward-security behaviour is covered by:

```bash
cargo test -p cardano-crypto-class --test kes_forward_security
```

## Benchmarks

Experimental KES performance benchmarks are provided (dev-only) via Criterion:

```bash
cargo bench -p cardano-crypto-class --bench kes_bench
```

The harness measures:

- Key generation (`keygen`)
- Signing (`sign` for sampled periods)
- Verification (`verify` for the same sampled periods)
- Bounded evolution cycles (`evolve+sign`, capped at 16 periods per iteration)

Algorithms included: `SingleKes`, `Sum4Kes`, and `CompactSum4Kes` to give a
representative leaf, mid-level tree, and compact branching comparison. Period
sampling (first/last windows) keeps runtime short while still exercising edge
periods.

Results (HTML + stdout summaries) form the initial baseline; future optimisations
should update both the README and CHANGELOG with notable improvements or changes
in asymptotic behaviour.

The `serialized_sizes` benchmark function prints raw byte lengths for verification keys
and signatures (plus total periods) to establish a reproducible size baseline without
platform-specific RSS sampling. (Signing key raw serialization is intentionally excluded
because exposing it publicly would require an "unsound" test-only trait not implemented
for production benchmarks.)

### Feature-gated metrics

Two lightweight, allocation-free instrumentation features exist to support diagnostics:

| Feature | Module | Counters | Overhead | Use Case |
|---------|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| `kes-metrics` | `kes::metrics` | signing_keys, signing_key_bytes, signatures, signature_bytes, updates | Single relaxed atomics per event | Benchmarking KES workload composition and mix |
| `mlocked-metrics` | `mlocked_metrics` | allocations, allocation_bytes, zeroizations, failed_locks | Single relaxed atomics per event | Observing secure memory allocation patterns |

Fetch a metrics snapshot (returns zeros when feature disabled):

```rust
#[cfg(feature = "mlocked-metrics")]
{
  let snap = cardano_crypto_class::mlocked_metrics::snapshot();
  eprintln!("allocations={} bytes={} zeroizations={}", snap.allocations, snap.allocation_bytes, snap.zeroizations);
}
```

Enable both in a one-off diagnostics run:

```bash
cargo test -p cardano-crypto-class --features kes-metrics,mlocked-metrics,serde -- --ignored
```

## Usage

### Deterministic entropy helpers

```rust
use cardano_crypto_class::{
  expand_seed,
  mk_seed_from_bytes,
  run_with_seed,
};
use sha2::Sha256;

let seed = mk_seed_from_bytes([0u8; 32]);
let (left, right) = expand_seed::<Sha256>(&seed);

let value = run_with_seed(left, |rng| {
  let mut buf = [0u8; 4];
  rng.fill_bytes_checked(&mut buf)?;
  Ok(u32::from_le_bytes(buf))
})
.expect("seeded RNG execution");

println!("deterministic value: {value}");

let bytes = cardano_crypto_class::decode_hex_string_or_panic!("0xdeadbeef", 4);
assert_eq!(bytes, b"\xde\xad\xbe\xef");

let lhs = cardano_crypto_class::pack_bytes::<8>(&[0xff; 8], 0);
let rhs = cardano_crypto_class::pack_bytes::<8>(&[0x0f; 8], 0);
let xored = cardano_crypto_class::xor_packed_bytes(&lhs, &rhs);
assert_eq!(xored.as_slice(), &[0xf0; 8]);
```

### Single-period KES lifecycle

```rust
use cardano_crypto_class::dsign::ed25519::Ed25519;
use cardano_crypto_class::kes::{KesAlgorithm, KesError, KesMError, SingleKes};

fn demo_single_kes() -> Result<(), KesMError> {
  let seed = vec![0u8; SingleKes::<Ed25519>::SEED_SIZE];
  let signing_key = SingleKes::<Ed25519>::gen_key_kes_from_seed_bytes(&seed)?;
  let verification_key = SingleKes::<Ed25519>::derive_verification_key(&signing_key)?;

  let message = b"boundary-check";
  let signature = SingleKes::<Ed25519>::sign_kes(&(), 0, message, &signing_key)?;
  SingleKes::<Ed25519>::verify_kes(&(), &verification_key, 0, message, &signature)?;

  // Attempting to sign beyond the single allowed period fails.
  assert!(matches!(
    SingleKes::<Ed25519>::sign_kes(&(), 1, message, &signing_key),
    Err(KesMError::Kes(KesError::PeriodOutOfRange { .. }))
  ));

  SingleKes::<Ed25519>::forget_signing_key_kes(signing_key);
  Ok(())
}

demo_single_kes().expect("single KES lifecycle");
```

> **Tip**: Enable the `serde` feature to access JSON vector helpers and fixtures
> shared with `cardano-test-vectors` when performing cross-language parity

> **Security note**: The `mlocked-metrics` feature reports aggregate counters only; it never exposes raw pointers or secret material sizes beyond total bytes allocated. Disable the feature for production builds.
