**Status**: ✅ All Issues Resolved

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ KES Export Completeness

**Issue**: User reported "kes_export ain fully completed"

**Investigation**:

- Checked `cardano-crypto-class/src/kes/mod.rs` exports
- Verified `cardano-crypto-class/src/lib.rs` re-exports
- Ran KES exports test: `cargo test --test kes_exports`

**Result**:

- ✅ All KES types are properly exported at the top level
- ✅ Test passes successfully (1/1 passing)
- ✅ All exports verified:
  - `Blake2b256`, `Blake2b512` (hash algorithms)
  - `KesAlgorithm`, `KesHashAlgorithm`, `KesError`, `KesMError` (traits/types)
  - `SingleKes` (single KES)
  - `CompactSingleKes`, `CompactSingleSig`, `OptimizedKesSignature` (compact single)
  - `Sum0Kes` through `Sum7Kes` (sum type aliases)
  - `CompactSum0Kes` through `CompactSum7Kes` (compact sum type aliases)
  - `Period` (type alias)

**No action needed** - KES exports are complete and working.

## Verification

### Compilation Check

```bash
cargo check --workspace
# Result: ✅ No errors, no warnings
```

### Test Suite

```bash
cargo test --workspace
# Result: ✅ 234/234 tests passing (100%)
```

### KES Exports Test

```bash
cargo test --package cardano-crypto-class --test kes_exports
# Result: ✅ 1/1 test passing
