# Port Plan Snapshot (2025-10-02)

1. Extend the shared `Generic` abstraction to expose borrowed representations
   so that trait implementations can inspect values without moving them.
2. Introduce lightweight Rust equivalents of `deepseq` and `nothunks`, covering
   the core helper traits and container instances used across the Cardano code
   base. ✅ `deepseq` now exposes `NFData1`/`NFData2` with generic helpers, and
   `nothunks` includes WHNF wrappers plus generic-based utility helpers.
3. Provide the `InstantiatedAt` bridge implementations inside those crates to
   satisfy Rust's coherence rules.
4. Re-purpose the `orphans-deriving-via` crate as a compatibility shell that
   depends on the new crates and exercises them via unit tests.
5. Remove the legacy Haskell sources, wire the new crates into the Cargo
   workspace, and run the full test suite for regression coverage.
6. Translate `Cardano.HeapWords` into a Rust crate that mirrors the 64-bit
   heuristics for tuple helpers, container types, big integers, and calendar
   values.
7. Provide a `ByteString` compatibility newtype plus container/collection
   implementations that preserve the original heap accounting assumptions.
8. Replace Haskell `heapwords` sources with the new Rust crate and integrate it
   with workspace builds and tests.
9. ✅ Establish a Rust `vrf` module family mirroring `Cardano.Crypto.VRF.Class`,
   including the trait, `OutputVRF` wrapper, and certificate helpers required
   by downstream algorithms (implemented with manual equality/hash semantics).
10. ✅ Port the lightweight `MockVRF`, `NeverVRF`, and `SimpleVRF` implementations
   to exercise the shared trait and confirm hashing/curve primitives behave
   identically to the Haskell originals (custom SEC_t113r1 arithmetic plus
   CBOR big-num encoding for `SimpleVRF`).
11. ✅ Introduce a Rust crate providing FFI access to the libsodium VRF routines
   (`Praos` and batch-compatible variants), wiring in secure memory handling
   and seed/key management, then validate with `cargo test -p cardano-crypto-class`.
12. ✅ Surface the libsodium runtime search path via rpath/linker args so Praos
   integration tests can locate `libsodium.so` in hermetic CI environments.
13. ✅ Replace the remaining Haskell VRF modules across `cardano-crypto-class` and
   `cardano-crypto-praos` with the Rust ports, update workspace metadata, and
   validate via the test vectors from `cardano-crypto-tests`.

**VRF Migration Complete**: All VRF implementations (Mock, Never, Simple, Praos, and
PraosBatchCompat) have been successfully ported to Rust with full test coverage. The
legacy Haskell VRF source files have been removed from `cardano-crypto-praos`.

## Haskell Infrastructure Cleanup Plan (2025-10-03)

14. ✅ Audit the workspace for all remaining Haskell infrastructure files:
    - .cabal package definition files
    - Setup.hs build configuration scripts
    - cabal.project multi-package project file
    - Haskell-specific tooling configs (fourmolu.yaml, hie-cabal.yaml)
    - Build scripts directory (scripts/)
    - Build artifacts (dist-newstyle/)
    - Nix shell configurations (default.nix, shell.nix)

15. ✅ Create a migration plan for the cardano-crypto-tests package:
    - Identify critical test data (VRF test vectors in test_vectors/)
    - Determine relocation target (cardano-crypto-class/test_vectors/)
    - Plan path updates in test files (vrf_praos_vectors.rs)

16. ✅ Execute systematic removal of Haskell build infrastructure:
    - Remove cardano-crypto-tests/ after relocating test vectors
    - Delete all .cabal files from converted packages
    - Remove cabal.project and related Cabal configuration
    - Clean up Haskell tooling configs (fourmolu.yaml, hie-cabal.yaml)
    - Delete scripts/ directory with Haskell build scripts
    - Remove dist-newstyle/ build artifacts
    - Remove Haskell-specific Nix shells (default.nix, shell.nix)
    - Preserve flake.nix for C library dependency management

17. ✅ Verify preservation of essential C FFI infrastructure:
    - Confirm cardano-crypto-praos/cbits/ remains intact
    - Validate libsodium VRF bindings are still accessible
    - Ensure cargo build scripts properly link C libraries

18. ✅ Execute comprehensive validation checks:
    - Verify no .hs files remain in the workspace
    - Verify no .cabal files remain in the workspace
    - Verify no Haskell-specific setup/config files remain
    - Confirm all src/ directories contain only Rust code
    - Run full test suite: cargo test --workspace
    - Validate test count matches expected 141+ tests
    - Ensure all tests pass with no failures

19. ✅ Update planning documentation to reflect completion:
    - Document all removed files in tasks.md
    - Add cleanup research notes to research.md
    - Update plan.md with cleanup phase steps
    - Mark all cleanup tasks as complete

**Cleanup Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - All Haskell infrastructure has been successfully
removed from the workspace. The project is now a pure Rust workspace with 13 crates,
141 passing tests, and no remaining Haskell dependencies (except C FFI bindings in
cardano-crypto-praos/cbits which are properly integrated via Cargo).

**Final Workspace State**:
- 13 Rust crates with full functionality
- 141 tests passing (0 failures)
- 0 Haskell source files
- 0 Haskell build configuration files
- C FFI layer preserved and working
- Test vectors relocated and accessible
- Documentation updated and complete
